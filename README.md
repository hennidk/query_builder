# Query Builder
---
This project contains a number of classes to help illustrate usage of the QueryBuilder class.  

The Query Builder will generate SQL strings, avoiding (as much as is possible) having to include SQL strings in code.

_**FYI**_  
_The unit tests will likely fail even if provided with valid database credentials, since you would need to create the database tables too._  
_It is really only intended to illustrate usage..._

## Usage
Check out the `QueryTests.cs` tests to see some common use cases where this builder might be of use.
